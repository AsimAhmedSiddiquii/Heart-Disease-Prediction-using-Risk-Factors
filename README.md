# Heart Disease Prediction using Risk Factors

- Almost all systems that predict heart diseases using clinical dataset having parameters and inputs from complex tests conducted in labs. 
  None of the systems predicts heart diseases supporting risk factors like age, case history, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, tobacco smoking, 
  alcohol intake, obesity or physical inactivity, etc. 
  
- Heart disease patients have many of those visible risk factors in common which may be used very effectively for diagnosis. 
  A system based on such risk factors would not only help medical professionals but it would give patients a warning about the probable presence 
  of heart disease even before the patient visits a hospital or goes for costly medical check-ups. 
  
- Hence this study presents a technique for prediction of heart disease using major risk factors with help of different Classifying Algorithms. 
  This technique involves four major classification algorithms such as K Neighbors, Support Vector, Decision Tree, Random Forest algorithms.
